<p>Work that we have completed :</p>
<p>We have made a simple website for an ice-cream company called Diazepam. We included pages about their stores and products. We also added an online ordering form for delivery services and a feedback form to comment on our services. We put in multiple pictures to attract customers and design very simply. We left the background only with white colour.</p>

<p>We managed to work on the website  even though we have multiple assignment happening and there is  an exam  3 days after the submission. The plus is that we manage to work together as a team and can make a good teamwork. The minus is that the time management of our team is very bad. Honestly, we barely do the assignment few days before submission and that causes us to be late. The interesting things is that we done the website in like 2 days before submission date. Although the product page is not so professional, we are very satisfied with the rest.</p>
